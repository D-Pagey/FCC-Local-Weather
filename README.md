## Local Weather App -  A Free Code Camp project

The is the 2nd of the "Intermediate" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
When I first completed this project using vanilla JS, the main challenge was
around conditionally display styles depending on the weather. In the React
version, it was interesting to see the usefulness of sticking everything in state. 

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can see the weather in my current location.
- [x] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot
  desert) depending on the weather.
- [x] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Conditionally displaying data
* Async functions
* Using Fetch API in vanila JS vs in React

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start`
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can see a Vanilla JS demo of this

*This project was retired in June 2018.*
