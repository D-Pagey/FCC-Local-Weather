## Local Weather App -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can see the weather in my current location.
- [x] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot
  desert) depending on the weather.
- [x] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

The most recent version of this project was written in React using
Create-React-App. It was really interesting to see how to manage the various
states of components in React versus how I handled it in the native version.

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla
JS version but not in the React version.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
