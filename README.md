## Local Weather App -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

I learnt a lot about working with APIs in native JavaScript on this project. At first I called the API using an XML HTTP Request and then I used the Fetch API. I also created separate CSS classes for each type of weather.
